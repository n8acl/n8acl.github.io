Welcome to my blog!

Here you will find my adventures in tech (programming, ham radio, home automation) with some other things thrown in along the way! You never know what you may find.

SQL Developer by day and Husband and Father by night. Not only do I enjoy tech, but also I enjoy fishing, shooting, smoking/BBQ (meat not weed), traveling, camping, Geocaching, and a multitude of other things. 

Hope you enjoy reading and find something useful! Please keep coming back to see more!
