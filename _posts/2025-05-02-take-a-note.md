## Introduction

Note taking is one of those things that can really be a pain in the... butt. Everyone has done a few of the same things over the years. From Post-it notes and scraps of paper to Word Docs, Evernote, or OneNote, every one has their own way that they like to take notes.

For years I used 2 apps almost exclusively, Apple Notes and OneNote. I used Apple Notes because it was convenient, I could sync between multiple devices and even use it in a browser. I used OneNote for all my development projects for work. I kept everything in one of those two Applications. However, I started looking for an alternative to Apple Notes when there was some kind of change that made Checklists not able to work in Firefox. I was not changing browsers, so I had to come up with a better more stable way. Enter Obsidian.
