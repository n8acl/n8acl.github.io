So about me. Where do I start.... There is so much about me you probably won't care about.

I was born at a tender young age in 1979 in Cincinnati, OH and like most Cincinnatians, have never left. I wasn't a total geek at first, but have grwon into one and wear that badge proudly.

I've been involved in tech and computers since about 4th grade (so... around 1988/1989). We had some Radio Shack TRS-80's (yep remember the old Trash 80's?) in the classroom and once our work was completed, we were allowed to use them. In order to run some of the programs, we would have to follow instructions to write a BASIC program that would launch the learning game we wanted to play. It wasn't much, but it was my first exposure to Computers and I loved it. 

Over the years, I got to play with computers off and on mostly playing games, but also learning how to start programming a little, but never really had one at home till I hit High School. There, I took some programming classes and got permission to spend time in the computer lab and that was really were my love for tech and programing took off. I started building some HTML websites (remember Geocites and Angelfire?) and really got a chance to start learning about programming. This is where I decided I wanted to do some something with computers and software development.

The first time through college, I had a student job in the Computer Lab and got to learn and play more. I ended up failing out, but as luck would have it, I got my first database job a year later. My supervisor at the time saw something in me and took a chance and I got to learn so much. I spent many years after that reading and doing alot of web searches and basically taught myself how to do everything I needed to do.

I learned all sorts of programming languages over the years which brings me to today.

I finally went back to school a few years ago and got my Bachelors and Masters Degrees. I have been working fulltime as a SQL Database Developer for almost 20 years now. I do alot of Python Development in my spare time. I am also an Amateur Radio Operator and most of the projects I work on are geared for that.

I setup my own home lab a few years ago and play with Linux, Macs, Raspberry PIs, Home Automation.. You name it, I have tried it.

SQL Devloper by day, husband and father by night. I am married to one of the most patient and wonderful women in the world. I have an awesome 7 Year old son and a fantastic 22 year old step son. 

Outside of tech, I have all sorts of varied interests. Fishing, camping, shooting, traveling, spending time with my family, playing board games and DnD, Geocaching, listening to podcasts. I just recently got a vertical electric smoker and have jumped into the world of smoking meat and BBQing. So while a geek, not totally geeky ;)

Thanks for reading and I hope you find something interesting within these pages.
