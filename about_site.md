Welcome to my blog!

This is yet another iteration of various blogs that I have had over the years. I have blogged about things from my everyday life to my competition shooting and now, I decided that I needed a place to do write up for my tech adventures. Programming, Ham Radio, Home Automation, a little of everything will go here. Don't be surprised however, if I slip in other hobbies too. Geocaching, fishing, smoking (meat not cigarettes or weed I promise).

In the past I have used Wordpress for my blogging adventures and while that is a great platform, It is a royal pain to deal with. Constant updates and tweaking. Backups are a pain to accomplish and if you happen to accidently reload a page during an update, you hose everything. But it is nice for dynamic sites and automating things so there is that positive. However, I don't really want to host Wordpress for myself, so I wanted an alternative.

I started researching and had been playing with Github Pages for documentation using MkDocs for projects and then I read about using Jeykell to create static sites using Github Pages. I know that alot of people are already doing it, so I figured, time to learn something new! And this was born.

I also have another static HTML site that I have been programming by hand, so I figured this would be the cool next step too.

I figured this would be a great place to not only poke around and learn, but it also combined my love of Git to be able to make updates to the site so much easier and faster. Plus I get to use Markdown, which is awesome!

Regardless, thank you for coming here and thank you for reading! I hope you take away something useful and keep coming back!
